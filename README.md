A python implementation of a L-layer neural network.
Intended for learning purposes while following Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.

Features included:
-gradient checking
-regularization (L2 and dropout)
-parameter update optimization(rmsprop, adam)
-minibatch training

TODO:
-Batch normalization

Usage:
model(X,Y,..)
optional params:
-initialization =("random" vs "he")


Future development:
-pass as command line parameters
